  abstract       = {The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a popular set of programs for discovering and genotyping variants from next-generation sequencing data. The current GATK recommendation for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is to perform variant calling from individual samples, with the drawback that only variable positions are reported. Versions 3.0 and above of GATK offer the possibility of calling DNA variants on cohorts of samples using the HaplotypeCaller algorithm in Genomic Variant Call Format (GVCF) mode. Using this approach, variants are called individually on each sample, generating one GVCF file per sample that lists genotype likelihoods and their genome annotations. In a second step, variants are called from the GVCF files through a joint genotyping analysis. This strategy is more flexible and reduces computational challenges in comparison to the traditional joint discovery workflow. Using a GVCF workflow for mining SNP in RNA-seq data provides substantial advantages, including reporting homozygous genotypes for the reference allele as well as missing data. Taking advantage of RNA-seq data derived from primary macrophages isolated from 50 cows, the GATK joint genotyping method for calling variants on RNA-seq data was validated by comparing this approach to a so-called "per-sample" method. In addition, pair-wise comparisons of the two methods were performed to evaluate their respective sensitivity, precision and accuracy using DNA genotypes from a companion study including the same 50 cows genotyped using either genotyping-by-sequencing or with the Bovine SNP50 Beadchip (imputed to the Bovine high density). Results indicate that both approaches are very close in their capacity of detecting reference variants and that the joint genotyping method is more sensitive than the per-sample method. Given that the joint genotyping method is more flexible and technically easier, we recommend this approach for variant calling in RNA-seq experiments.},

Prevailing methods rely on cost-intensive whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) approaches while the identification of genomic variants from often existing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data remains a challenge because of the intrinsic complexity in the transcriptome. Here, we present a highly accurate approach termed SNPiR to identify SNPs in RNA-seq data. We applied SNPiR to RNA-seq data of samples for which WGS and WES data are also available and achieved high specificity and sensitivity. Of the SNPs called from the RNA-seq data, >98% were also identified by WGS or WES. Over 70% of all expressed coding variants were identified from RNA-seq, and comparable numbers of exonic variants were identified in RNA-seq and WES. Despite our method's limitation in detecting variants in expressed regions only, our results demonstrate that SNPiR outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for variant detection from RNA-seq data and offers a cost-effective and reliable alternative for SNP discovery.},

Accurate variant calling in NGS data is a critical step upon which virtually all downstream analysis and interpretation processes rely. Just as NGS technologies have evolved considerably over the past 10 years, so too have the software tools and approaches for detecting sequence variants in clinical samples. In this review, I discuss the current best practices for variant calling in clinical sequencing studies, with a particular emphasis on trio sequencing for inherited disorders and somatic mutation detection in cancer patients. I describe the relative strengths and weaknesses of panel, exome, and whole-genome sequencing for variant detection. Recommended tools and strategies for calling variants of different classes are also provided, along with guidance on variant review, validation, and benchmarking to ensure optimal performance. Although NGS technologies are continually evolving, and new capabilities (such as long-read single-molecule sequencing) are emerging, the "best practice" principles in this review should be relevant to clinical variant calling in the long term.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of paratuberculosis, or Johne's disease (JD), an incurable bovine disease. The evidence for susceptibility to MAP disease points to multiple interacting factors, including the genetic predisposition to a dysregulation of the immune system. The endemic situation in cattle populations can be in part explained by a genetic susceptibility to MAP infection. In order to identify the best genetic improvement strategy that will lead to a significant reduction of JD in the population, we need to understand the link between genetic variability and the biological systems that MAP targets in its assault to dominate macrophages. MAP survives in macrophages where it disseminates. We used next-generation RNA (RNA-Seq) sequencing to study of the transcriptome in response to MAP infection of the macrophages from cows that have been naturally infected and identified as positive for JD (JD (+); n = 22) or negative for JD (healthy/resistant, JD (-); n = 28). In addition to identifying genetic variants from RNA-seq data, SNP variants were also identified using the Bovine SNP50 DNA chip. RESULTS: The complementary strategy allowed the identification of 1,356,248 genetic variants, including 814,168 RNA-seq and 591,220 DNA chip variants. Annotation using SnpEff predicted that the 2435 RNA-seq genetic variants would produce high functional effect on known genes in comparison to the 33 DNA chip variants. Significant variants from JD(+/-) macrophages were identified by genome-wide association study and revealed two quantitative traits loci: BTA4 and 11 at (P < 5 × 10(- 7)). Using BovineMine, gene expression levels together with significant genomic variants revealed pathways that potentially influence JD susceptibility, notably the energy-dependent regulation of mTOR by LKB1-AMPK and the metabolism of lipids. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we succeeded in identifying genetic variants in regulatory pathways of the macrophages that may affect the susceptibility of cows that are healthy/resistant to MAP infection. RNA-seq provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate gene expression and to link the genetic variations to biological pathways that MAP normally manipulate during the process of killing macrophages. A strategy incorporating functional markers into genetic selection may have a considerable impact in improving resistance to an incurable disease. Integrating the findings of this research into the conventional genetic selection program may allow faster and more lasting improvement in resistance to bovine paratuberculosis in dairy cattle.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. To align our large (>80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.},
